# CSV Generator - Pre-filled Information on Media Packages
While working as a VFX Production Assistant, I created this Bash script to help me share information related to media packages my company regularly sent to our vendors. 
I generated this information in a CSV file and then uploaded it to shared online software used in VFX Production for scheduling etc. called [Shotgrid](https://www.autodesk.com/products/shotgrid/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription).
